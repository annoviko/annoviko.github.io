The last year was not just another year. It was full of various unpleasant events and one of the most unexpected is COVID-19. How to entertain yourself during that time when you have to sit at home? One of the ways to spend time with fun is solve a set of tasks Advent of Code. This year I participated in this event and had enough motivation to finish all programming puzzles. It is not just a set of tasks like on leetcode, it is a set of tasks that are connected to each other with a well-written story. It is almost like a book with interested programming puzzles related to the narrative.

The programming puzzles in Advent of Code 2020 were based on the following topics:

1. Regular expressions.
2. Chinese theorem.
3. Binary search.
4. Dynamic programming.
5. Efficient usage of suitable data structures.
6. Polish and reverse Polish notation.
7. Backtracking.
8. Simulation.
9. Math.
10. Encryption basics.
11. All other technics that are used to build optimal solutions.

Advent of Code can be considered as a remarkably interesting way of polishing and improving your development and problem solving skills. Be aware, if your solution is not optimal (for example, you implemented brute force algorithm) then be ready to spend several hours/days waiting for an answer. Do not rush, just relax and enjoy, because there are no deadlines, you can solve every task when you have free time.

However, if you stuck, do not give up, read corresponding threads on Reddit or you can take a look at my solutions considering them as hints. I solved all programming puzzles using C++ language and place them on my personal github repository, so I hope you will find it useful: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/annoviko/sandbox/tree/master/advent-2020). Enjoy!
